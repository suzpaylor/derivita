# Project Title

Derivita Challenge

## Getting Started

Go to the following site to see the sample card:

This took me about 2 - 3 hours total to create it as exact as the template.



### Installing

The sample sent had very specific width's and proportions - I approached this in the sense of a template for a publication, respecting those designated widths and keeping the card centered on the page.  Normally I would do this completely with FlexBox - but without knowing the final use for this card I kept within the specifications.  For an example of how I would do this with flexbox look at the projects on my portfolio page - all built without bootstrap as a coding exercise:  Each card has a minimum width of about 320 pixels, but the content remains centered.

The cards could have been created much faster using bootstrap - but that would defeat the purpose of a coding exercise.  CSS grid is another powerful and responsive tool.  

### Reference

CSS-tricks - always my favorite for a quick reminder of how to use flex-box, flex-direction, etc.
W3-schools - for simple jQuery etc.
